# Claude Code for VS Code

Unleash Claude’s raw power directly in your terminal. Search million-line codebases instantly. Turn hours-long workflows into a single command. Your tools. Your workflow. Your codebase, evolving at thought speed.

- **Powerful intelligence:** Use the latest Claude models using your Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise subscription, or pay-as-you-go pricing
- **Works alongside you:** Claude autonomously explores your codebase, reads and writes code, and runs Terminal commands with your permission.
- **New, friendlier interface** that makes it easier than ever to get started
- **Integrated with the editor:** Claude knows about your current file and text selection, and proposes changes directly inside your editor window.
- **Powerful agentic features** like subagents, custom slash commands, and MCP are supported. (These features work in the VS Code extension, but some can only be configured using the command-line interface)

## Prefer the Terminal-based extension?

If you miss the Terminal-style experience of the previous extension, don’t worry! It hasn’t gone anywhere. Use the `Claude Code: Use Terminal` setting to switch back.

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.98.0 or higher
